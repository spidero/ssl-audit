A lightweight Python tool for scanning HTTPS/TLS configuration — similar in spirit to SSL Labs, but fast and self-hosted.  
It checks supported TLS versions, certificate details, HTTP headers (HSTS), OCSP stapling, ALPN/HTTP2, and CAA records.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects supported TLS versions (1.0–1.3)
- Extracts certificate info (CN, SAN, issuer, validity, signature algorithm)
- Checks HSTS, HTTP/2, ALPN, and OCSP stapling
- Verifies weak/strong cipher support
- Assigns a simple A+–F grade based on security level
